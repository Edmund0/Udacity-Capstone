# Udacity-Capstone

This project makes use of express (sever) and webpack to render a webpage. 

NOTE: If the destination entered does not exist in the Geonames database (or was written incorrectly), an error message will be returned!

                // console.log(formData);
                alert("The destination entered is invalid, please check the spelling and try again!");

WARNING: My project uses environmental variables for the API Keys (Geo_API, Weatherbit_API, Pixabay_API)
